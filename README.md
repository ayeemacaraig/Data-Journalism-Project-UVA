# ‘Enemy of the People’: How Populists threaten the Media  
## by Ayee Macaraig

“‘Dictator’ is not an insulting word.”

Turkish journalist Husnu Mahalli strived in vain to defend himself from a two-year prison sentence. His crime? Insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mahalli is not the sole journalist facing threats from a populist averse to criticism. From jailing reporters, threatening to punch them, deploying trolls, to withholding paper and ink to literally stop the press, populists worldwide have branded the media as “the enemy of the people”. 

The rise of figures like Erdogan and US President Donald Trump raised questions about the relationship between populism and the free press. Are firebrand leaders inherently anti-media? Who are the most populist politicians and who have the worst press freedom records? Where do they come from? 

Using data from from a global network of academics and annual press freedom scores, The Guardian explores key trends related to populism and media freedom. Here are four things you need to know about charismatic leaders and their tightening grip on the media.

### 1. ‘Positive’ relationship 

The Global Populism Database defines populism as rhetoric pitting the people’s will against the elite, and gives leaders a populism score per term based on speeches. 

Combining the database with Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) World Press Freedom Index for 2013-2020, one trend emerges. As populism increases, a country’s press freedom situation worsens. 

A statistical measure known as correlation coefficient shows this trend, called a “positive relationship”. But the name means the opposite for free speech advocates. 

The relationship supports media watchdogs’ concern about declining press freedom even in established democracies coinciding with the populist surge in the last seven years.  

“Populist leaders today constitute a new and growing challenge to free expression,” said Freedom House president Michael Abramowitz. 

RSF likewise warned against a “climate of hatred” from outsider politicians fuelling “an unprecedented level of fear and danger”. 

### 2. Worst press freedom under Erdogan  

Of the populists in the database, Erdogan leads those with the worst press freedom. In 2018, Turkey scored 53.5 in RSF’s index, meaning a “difficult situation”, on a scale of 0-100 where the higher the figure, the worse the press freedom. 

The reasons are clear. Amnesty International calls Turkey the world’s largest prison for journalists. In October, the European Union criticized the candidate country’s “serious backsliding” in free expression following a 2016 coup attempt. 

Insulting journalists is part of Erdogan’s populist discourse, RSF said. He had a populism score of 1.47 in 2018 on a scale of 0-2 where 1 is “clearly populist” and 2 is “extremely populist”. 

“If you do not know your place, this nation will hit you in the back of your neck,” Erdogan told a broadcaster last year. 

Verbal attacks are also a tactic of seven other “clearly populist” leaders.

Former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, the most populist politician in the database, called journalists “cowards” and “liars”. 

Even before Trump popularized “fake news”, Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez attacked newspapers for “fake” reporting. 

Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega has a different style. The president of the Central American nation refused to release paper and ink from the customs agency to newspapers, damaging their business.

### 3. Trump, Putin, Orban and Bolsonaro 

Besides Erdogan, Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are also in the database. These four scored as “somewhat populist”.

In this group, Putin trails Erdogan in having the worst press freedom. In 2018, RSF warned Putin against “going down in history as gravedigger of freedoms” in Russia. 

In the worst media freedom situation since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia under Putin jails reporters, targets media with trolls, and declares journalists as “foreign agents” for receiving overseas funding. 

Bolsonaro has the third worst press freedom score of the five populists. The so-called “Tropical Trump” is fond of harassing journalists, even threatening to punch a reporter in the face for asking about corruption allegations against his wife. Women journalists also face sexualized attacks.

Orban has the second highest populism score next to Erdogan. Hungary has a “problematic” press freedom situation with Orban’s allies owning 80% of media outlets, a propaganda machine producing nearly identical front pages. 

While Trump leads the country with the best press freedom score of the five populists, he edges out Putin and Bolsonaro in populist rhetoric. The US has a “satisfactory” press freedom situation but RSF noted that the period under Trump is one of American journalism’s “darkest moments”. 

“Never before have US journalists been subjected to so many death threats,” RSF said. 

Demonizing journalists as “lamestream media”, Trump has gone as far as cheering police violence against reporters covering protests as “a beautiful thing”. 

### 4. Regional hotspots 

Turning to regions, Latin America has the highest average populism score, followed by Central Asia. 

Called the land of populism, Latin America has a long history of populists which scholars linked to fragile institutions and weak rule of law. 

Academic Silvio Waisbord said Latin American populists exercise tight media control, partly explaining the region’s “problematic” press freedom score of 31.3. 

Strongmen-ruled Central Asia also has a “difficult” press freedom situation. Turkmenistan, for instance, ranked second last in RSF’s 2020 index, next only to North Korea, where it is almost impossible to work as a journalist. 

South Asia topped the list for having the worst press freedom score of 42.8, a “difficult situation”. It is home to populists like India’s Narendra Modi. 

The region though has long been known as “the most dangerous place for journalists”, due to various factors including conflict and repression. 

### Receding wave? 

With populism historically coming and going in waves, Trump’s 2020 election defeat prompted talk about the start of the end of the populist surge and its threats on the free press. 

While analysts debate the implications of the fall of populism’s standard-bearer, journalists in other parts of the globe such as Turkey’s Mahalli persist in fighting for their freedom to criticize and their liberty. 

“I have not insulted the president. I demand my acquittal.”
